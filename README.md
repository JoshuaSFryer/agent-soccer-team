## How to compile

From the project's root directory:

```
ant -f bin/agent_soccer_team.xml jar
```

Note that ant _must_ be installed, as the ant JAR provided by Jason doesn't accept command line arguments which are needed to specify the `build.xml` location.

## How to run

### Prerequisites

TODO: Something about having a Krislet server running

### Method 1 - Directly running the JAR

Run the `agent_soccer_team.jar` file by simply double-clicking it.

### Method 2 - Running via command line

```
java -jar agent_soccer_team.jar
```
